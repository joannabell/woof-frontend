# Overview

Looking for a restaurant that you can enjoy and your furry best friend? Look no further, you've found it. Woof was designed with both of you in mind. Search restaurants to find one near you along with their type of food and user ratings. 


# Technology

This app was built using React and Ruby as well as Active Model Serializers, NodeJS and React Router Dom.


# Functionality

| Search |

Search by restaurant in the search bar at the top of the page. Notice the real-time changes to the restaurant listings below.

| Add New Restaurant |

Because we can't be everywhere all at once, we need your help. Add as many new restaurants as you'd like and they'll be uploaded to our database.

| Favorites |

Every restaurant has a love button. If you visit one and love it, click the button and it'll be saved to your own personal Favorites page. 

| Delete A Restaurant |

If you had a bad experience and want to prevent other Woof-ers from the same, delete it. (And, then, go and add more).

| Find Now! |

If you don't feel like searching, use the Find Now! button to quickly go directly to the restaurant listings.


# Next Steps

There are always ways to improve an app. For Woof, our goal is to continually improve the design (CSS) and user experience. And, we're always open to feedback!
